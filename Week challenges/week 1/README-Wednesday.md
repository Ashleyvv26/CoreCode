#### âœ… Learn about binary, decimal and hexadecimal numbers
ðŸ’¡Let's summarize the concepts
   > Base 10 (Decimal): Represent any number using 10 digits [0â€“9]
   > 
   > Base 2 (Binary): Represent any number using 2 digits [0â€“1]
   > 
   > Base 16(Hexadecimal): Represent any number using 10 digits and 6 characters [0â€“9, A, B, C, D, E, F]
#### âœ… Translate the year you where born to binary, decimal and hexadecimal
|      | Birth Year| Binary | Decimal|Hexadecimal|
|:-------------:| :---: |:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|
|Operation |1996| <table>  <thead>  <tbody> <tr>  <td>2<sup>0</sup></td>  <td>0</td>  </tr> <tr>  <td>2<sup>1</sup></td>  <td>0</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>2<sup>2</sup></td>  <td>1</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>2<sup>3</sup></td>  <td>1</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>2<sup>4</sup></td>  <td>0</td>  </tr> <tr>  <td>2<sup>5</sup></td>  <td>0</td>  </tr> <tr>  <td>2<sup>6</sup></td>  <td>1</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>2<sup>7</sup></td>  <td>1</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>2<sup>8</sup></td>  <td>1</td>  </tr>  <tr>  <td>2<sup>9</sup></td>  <td>1</td>  </tr> <tr>  <td>2<sup>10</sup></td>  <td>1</td>  </tr>  </tbody>  </table>| 6+(10 * 9) + (100 * 9) + (1000 * 1)|11111001100 |

#### âœ…Translate 51966 into hexadecimal and binary
  ALGORITHM:
  
  > 1. Get the amount of money that you want to calculate.
  > 2. Investigate how much is your local currency exchange in USD. 
  > 3. Divide the desired amount of money you wanted to calculate by the amount of your local currency exchange in USD.
  > 4. If you want to check if you did correctly that calculation, check this link for more information [Currency Web Site](https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/) 

#### âœ…Use a Low-level language, for example MIPS aseembler, to do so, you will need to follow this guide. We recomend to check the guide first but also this presentation could be helpful.
#### âœ…Base on the examples and the guide of the low-level language: 5.1 Create a program to add two numbers given by the user 5.2 Create a program that display your name
  > It can help us to connect human ideas to a computer executor. We can use our own pseudocode to solve the problems, and also helps us to explain what each line in a software program should do. At the end, after undertanding everything, we can move to the next step that is programming with the language you want to write using the correct syntax of it and the rest of rules the language has.
#### âœ…Create a pseudocode to calculate the aproximated age of a user base on the year they born, (you can define a variable with the actual year if you need it, like for example i could define Y <-- 2022)
        1. START
        2. BIRTH_YEAR <-- GET
        3. ACTUAL_YEAR <-- GET
        4. AGE <-- ACTUAL_YEAR - BIRTH_YEAR
        5. PRINT AGE
        6. END
        
#### âœ…Read about flowcharts
#### âœ…Answer to the question: Why are flowcharts important to us as developers?
   > Flowcharts can help developers to create the most efficient coding because they can clearly see where the data is going to end up. An algorithm is a step-by-step analysis of the process, while a flowchart explains the steps of a program in a graphical way.
