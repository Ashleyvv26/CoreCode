#### ✅ Watch video about compilation and interpretation
#### ✅ Search and answer the question: Java language is compiled or interpreted?
   > Java is language that is interpreted but it's also compiled, why? depending on the execution environment bytecode can be:
   > - Compiled ahead of time and executed as native code (similar to most C++ compilers)
   > - Compiled just-in-time and executed
   > - Interpreted
   > - Directly executed by a supported processor
#### ✅Create an algorithm to calculate the equivalent of your local currencty to USD
  ALGORITHM:
  
  > 1. Get the amount of money that you want to calculate.
  > 2. Investigate how much is your local currency exchange in USD. 
  > 3. Divide the desired amount of money you wanted to calculate by the amount of your local currency exchange in USD.
  > 4. If you want to check if you did correctly that calculation, check this link for more information [Currency Web Site](https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/) 

#### ✅Read about Pseudocode
#### ✅Anwser to the question: Why is pseudocode helpful?
  > It can help us to connect human ideas to a computer executor. We can use our own pseudocode to solve the problems, and also helps us to explain what each line in a software program should do. At the end, after undertanding everything, we can move to the next step that is programming with the language you want to write using the correct syntax of it and the rest of rules the language has.
#### ✅Create a pseudocode to calculate the aproximated age of a user base on the year they born, (you can define a variable with the actual year if you need it, like for example i could define Y <-- 2022)
        1. START
        2. BIRTH_YEAR <-- GET
        3. ACTUAL_YEAR <-- GET
        4. AGE <-- ACTUAL_YEAR - BIRTH_YEAR
        5. PRINT AGE
        6. END
        
#### ✅Read about flowcharts
#### ✅Answer to the question: Why are flowcharts important to us as developers?
   > Flowcharts can help developers to create the most efficient coding because they can clearly see where the data is going to end up. An algorithm is a step-by-step analysis of the process, while a flowchart explains the steps of a program in a graphical way.
